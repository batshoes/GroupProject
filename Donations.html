			<p>Our programs rely on the support of individuals and
				organizations to ensure a future for the African wildlife.
				To those who have helped us in the past we give our grateful
				thanks. To those who wish to begin supporting our programs
				we offer a variety of ways for you to do so. From helping to
				save endangered species like rhinos to confronting
				challenges such as poaching, climate change and deforestation,
				your gift supports conservation efforts in South Africa.
				The wildlife and wild lands of Africa need you now more than ever.
				Your gift today will go directly to work helping us protect some of
				Africa's rarest species. Plus, you will support our efforts to
				empower the people of Africa with the tools to lead in conserving
				their natural heritage. Thank you for your generosity!</p>
