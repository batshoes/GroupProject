		<h1>How Can You Help?</h1>
		<p>Every year thousands of animals perish because of the violent nature of Poachers in Africa. Being sold for their natural resources, you can help them by donating and by actively pursuiting the correct treatment of game animals.	</p>
		<p>The things needed to help maintain the health and wellbeing of the animals are: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Game Reserves</li>
				<li>Training for Rangers</li>
				<li>Tools and equipment</li>
			</ul>
		<p>A donation of $50 is enough to provide a full range of training and equipment for a ranger to begin working full time.</p>
		
		<p>A donation of $25 is enough to educate a class of students to the disadvantages of Poaching.</p>
